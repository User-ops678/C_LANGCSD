# C Language in csd, lesson HY-100.


I Try my best to write all the code the teacher gave us, So if there are problems feel free to fix them. I wrote the code in order to see what the teacher did,
so becaus it is pretty fast, i am not able to check for errors, because i need to do other stuff as well :)
If you want to test your knowlage on the c programming lanuage, you can try to fix the errors in the files. Dont ask me to fix all the files :) if you want help,
you can try to ask me or ask the teacher! Thats it! Hope you find it usefull!
